# ProSit 0: Object-Oriented Design and Java Programming

## Partie 1: 
As a newly hired engineer at ESPRIT, youâ€™ve joined a development team responsible for creating Java-based programs. 

Your first task is a 20-minute test where you need to develop a Java program that:

- Declares two integers `n1` (initialized to 5) and `n2` (initialized to 6).
- Declares a floating-point variable named `somme` and initializes it to 0.
- Sums `n1` and `n2` and stores the result in `somme`.
- Displays the result of `somme` with a message: "Le resultat est : RESULTAT_SOMME".

## Partie 2: 
Once you complete the first part, your supervisor asks you to compile and run the Java program using the command line.

- What are the Java commands you should use?
- Did you successfully compile the code? If not, what do you need to do?

## Partie 3: 
Declare a method that returns the sum of two integers.

## Partie 4: 
Declare a method that prints an integer.
Use this method to display the returned sum.

## Partie 6: 
In this part, you are asked to modify the Java code so that the user can input the numbers to be summed. You have 15 minutes to complete this task.

## Partie 7: 
Finally, your supervisor suggests further modifying the Java code by writing a program that prompts the user to input a number and displays its double. (Hint: Use `Scanner`.)

## Partie 8: 
Implement a method that allows input of a positive integer. Modify the program to use this method.

## Partie 9: 
- Implement a method that returns the result of dividing two integers.
- Implement a method that handles input of a non-zero integer.
- Modify the program to call these implemented methods.
